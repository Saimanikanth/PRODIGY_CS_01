IMPLEMENT CEASER CIPHER

The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to communicate with his generals.
Here's an example with a shift of 3:

Original: HELLO
Encrypted: KHOOR

In this case, each letter in "HELLO" is shifted by 3 positions to the right in the alphabet, resulting in "KHOOR".
To decrypt, you simply reverse the process by shifting the letters back by the same number of positions.
It's a straightforward method, but also quite easy to crack without additional complexity or techniques.
